# Cockail App

This is a quick learning exercise to learn swift, storybaords and CoreData.

It's a simple application with a simple UI that lets a user add or create a list of cocktails with ingredients and instructions. Uses a delegate for abstraction from coredata so can relatively easily get swapped out to firebase or any other database architecture.
